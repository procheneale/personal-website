My name is Paul. I enjoy creating software on the cloud. My passion for the cloud began when I created my first neural network using Google Colab.

Over the past few years, I worked on projects revolving around Big Data, Machine Learning, and Computer Vision.

Currently, I have the privelege of working with Amazon Web Services as a Cloud Engineer. I focus on providing best practices, architecting, and building services on the cloud.
